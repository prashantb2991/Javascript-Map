### Markdown

So here’s a breakdown of what it does exactly, and how to use it.
And by the way, if you need to catch up on JavaScript itself, I suggest you check out our JavaScript Primer first.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/prashantb2991/prashantbiradar.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
